# Run tests after feature completion

After completing any feature or non-trivial change:

1. **Run the relevant tests** – Use `php artisan test` with a filter or filename that covers the changed code (e.g. `php artisan test --filter=TransactionQuery` or `php artisan test tests/Feature/Queries/TransactionQueryTest.php`).
2. **Confirm nothing is breaking** – Ensure the run finishes with all tests passing before considering the work done.
3. **If you ran only a subset** – Ask the user if they want to run the full test suite (`php artisan test`) to confirm everything still passes.

Do not mark a feature as complete without having run and passed the related tests.
